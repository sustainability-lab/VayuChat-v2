What was the percentage change in PM2.5 levels in Varanasi before and after the implementation of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)?,-61.208,,The percentage change in PM2.5 levels in Varanasi before and after the implementation of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is -61.21%.,TRUE,"content='To find the percentage change in PM2.5 levels in Varanasi before and after the implementation of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), we first need to filter the data for Varanasi station and then find the average PM2.5 levels before and after the implementation date.\n\nLet\'s assume the NCAP was implemented on 2019-01-01. We can filter the data using the following code:\n\n```python\nvaranasi_df = df[df[""station""] == ""Varanasi""]\nbefore_ncap_df = varanasi_df[varanasi_df[""Timestamp""] < ""2019-01-01""]\nafter_ncap_df = varanasi_df[varanasi_df[""Timestamp""] >= ""2019-01-01""]\n```\n\nNow, we can find the average PM2.5 levels before and after NCAP using the `mean()` function:\n\n```python\nbefore_ncap_avg = before_ncap_df[""PM2.5""].mean()\nafter_ncap_avg = after_ncap_df[""PM2.5""].mean()\n```\n\nFinally, we can calculate the percentage change using the following formula:\n\n```python\npercentage_change = ((after_ncap_avg - before_ncap_avg) / before_ncap_avg) * 100\n```\n\nSo, the final code would look like this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(""Data.csv"")\ndf[""Timestamp""] = pd.to_datetime(df[""Timestamp""])\n\nvaranasi_df = df[df[""station""] == ""Varanasi""]\nbefore_ncap_df = varanasi_df[varanasi_df[""Timestamp""] < ""2019-01-01""]\nafter_ncap_df = varanasi_df[varanasi_df[""Timestamp""] >= ""2019-01-01""]\n\nbefore_ncap_avg = before_ncap_df[""PM2.5""].mean()\nafter_ncap_avg = after_ncap_df[""PM2.5""].mean()\n\npercentage_change = ((after_ncap_avg - before_ncap_avg) / before_ncap_avg) * 100\n\nanswer = f""The percentage change in PM2.5 levels in Varanasi before and after the implementation of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is {percentage_change:.2f}%.""\n```\n\nNote: The actual percentage change may vary depending on the actual implementation date of the NCAP.' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_time': 1.008675864, 'completion_tokens': 634, 'prompt_time': 0.016755465, 'prompt_tokens': 330, 'queue_time': None, 'total_time': 1.025431329, 'total_tokens': 964}, 'model_name': 'mixtral-8x7b-32768', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_c5f20b5bb1', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-158bdf2f-55bd-4b7c-8a46-c03efde070f3-0'",FALSE,"Error: invalid decimal literal (<string>, line 34)",FALSE,"The percentage change in PM2.5 levels in Varanasi before the implementation of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) was 2.12%.
